# fetalhealth
This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:

Normal (1)
Suspect (2)
Pathological (3) represented with numbers in the fetal_health column.


Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and 
maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, 
uterine contractions and more.
